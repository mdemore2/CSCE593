Follow these steps to use git to add a source file into your repo. Afterwards you will modify
some code and commit your changes.

1) Everything between the asterics (*) is the C++ code you should place into a file called:
      hello.cpp (case sensitive)

2) Perform a git add to add your new source file into your repository.
      git add hello.cpp
      
3) Everything between the octothorpes (#) is the Text data you should place into a file called:
      MyFile.txt (case sensitive)

4) Perform a git add to add your new text file into your repository.
      git add MyFile.txt
      
5) Perform a git commit to commit your new files into your local repo (the .git folder). Change your commit message.      
      git commit -am "o This is my commit message, I type a useful human readable description of what I am contributing with this commit..."

6) Perform a git push to push your local repo with the repo at git.nykl.net.

7) Modify hello.cpp to pad line numbers using 0 (zero).

8) After updating the code, commit *and* push your changes.

9) Log into https://git.nykl.net and validate that the hello.cpp residing on the server *is* the
   latest version you just pushed.
