CSCE 593 - Intro to Software Engineering.

This course is concerned with the development of large-scale software systems (i.e., systems
which have a large software component). Techniques in software requirements elicitation,
object-oriented design, implementation, quality assurance, and project management are
presented, along with discussion of the software development process. Emphasis is on objectoriented
modeling using a subset of the Unified Modeling Language (UML). Techniques to
facilitate the engineering of secure software systems are introduced. This course will enable
you to more effectively communicate with software users and developers and make sound
management decisions. Hands-on experience is provided through papers, labs, individual
homework problems, and a group project.
